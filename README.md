# DankiCode

This folder was created following the "Complete Game Development Course" offered by Danki Code (Curso Desenvolvimento de Games Completo), a brazilian group of instructors.
This course teaches game development using Java, Unity and other languages/tools. Please note that some projects/code may differ from the instructor's result due to
experimentation/creativity that I decided to change.
